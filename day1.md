"Every bad thing that can happen in the real world can now happen on the internet"

Designed community - Columbia, MD

Can you install standards and intention into design so that a system scales? Standards and growth

We are foundational. Design is iterative but foundational work is so important

be intentional about who you put in your comunity; where the roads are. If we can agree that the web needs to live on a foundation of inclusiveness, we can move toward that goal.

things we can do: 
    - don't believe the hype. don't let the unicorns rule
    - do more by doing less. just listen
    - don't wait for anyone's permission to do anything

What is poor design?

 - Right intention, poorly rendered
 - Wrong intention, rendered correctly

Six flags: designs park as activities; Disney designs parks as experiences. Similarly a great design process is designed as an experience.

Designing the design process:

 - Who's on the team?
 - How will they add value?
 - When will they need support?
 - How do we introduce the process?
 - Who gets credit?
 - Who takes the blame?

The most effective design teams worship inclusiveness.

Expectancy bias: if we go into a room thinking some people are expert designers and some are not designers, how does that shape outcomes? 

The design team is *anyone* who influences the rendering of intent.

### Growth stages of understanding
 1. **unconscious incompetence:** we're not good at what we do, don't know how bad we are. Poor outcomes without realizing it
 
 *literacy: sees the difference between good and poor quality* 

  - playbook: start a usability program, teach team, socialize journey maps, start an immersive exposure program (i.e. meet your users!), integrate story mapping

 2. **conscious incompetence** now aware that outcomes are poor quality. Many people stop here.
 
 *fluency: learns how to get good results - repeated practice of procedures*

 - playbook: get secondary influencers into projects early, create a ui controlled vocabulary, create a voice and tone guide, create feature-level personas

 3. **conscious competence** - follows defined procedures to produce good quality outcomes
 
 *mastery: doesn't have to think about it anymore; comprehensive knowledge and craftsmanship for intuitive work*

 4. **unconscious competence** - doesn't need to think about it. Makes good quality outcomes without needing to consider it.

Goal: bring design team to state of understanding about design. Conscious competence at least. But you must come into the room with the expectation that every team member has design potential.
